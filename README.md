# TicTacToe-Game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game on a 3Ã—3 grid. Players take turns marking squares with 'X' or 'O', aiming to align three in a row, column, or diagonal. The first to do so wins; if the grid fills without a winner, it's a draw. Simple yet strategic, the game enhances logical thinking and decision-making skills.
